# Description
Embedr is a simple way to embed high-quality images from cultural heritage institutions. Embedr introduces a playful way to explore, share and use these images.

## Embedding done right
All of Embedrâ€™s images are made available by cultural heritage organisations who have made a large effort to digitise their collections at high quality, and are willing to share them with a wider audience. These cultural institutions deserve good attribution; acknowledgement for what this work is and where it comes from.

Attribution information is attached when you embed an image from Embedr on another website. This means that you do not need to think about providing attribution anymore.

## High resolution
All images on Embedr are high-quality images with a resolution of 4 megapixels or more. This resolution makes it possible to explore the image in deeper and more meaningful ways, to zoom in to even the smallest detail. Embedr lets you play around with the image. You can zoom, pan and make a selection, discover new aspects of the image until you find the detail that you are interested in.

Embedr gives you the option to embed the full image or a selection of the image. The image can be embedded as a static image that does not move, or as an image that lets visitors of your site zoom and pan.
